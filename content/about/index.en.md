# About
Hello there, I am Rufina Talalaeva, and my nickname is `rufusnufus`. 

I'm currently getting a Computer Science Bachelor degree at Innopolis University and working as a Junior DevOps engineer.

Since the first year of the university, I have been trying to find my place in IT.
I am a person who quickly gets carried away with something new, and then fades away.
I tried myself in Frontend, Backend, ML directions, applying for internships, taking courses, performing university projects and participating in hackathons.
However, I didn't see myself in these areas.

Later, in March 2020, I saw an internship in the DevOps direction in one company and just applied.
You never know what you'll like until you try it. The company took me - shock content!
Our group of interns was supervised by 3 mentors. We were given tasks with a tiny responsibility, but we contributed real projects.
Although it didn't work out all at once, it was very exciting.
One of the mentors became an authority for me, he always answered on any arosed question in a minute, whether it was 7 a.m. or 1 a.m.
I wanted to look up to him, know as much and be as hard working as him.
Later I got a job at this company, the mentor took me to one of his projects. After working together for 3 months, he left the companyðŸ˜”

That's how my lonely junior journey begins, but the path should be interesting.
Here I write about the tasks that I am doing now. I write this blog just for laughing at myself and the simplest tasks that previously seemed unaffordable.
